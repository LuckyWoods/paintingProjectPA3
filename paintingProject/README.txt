Info: PA3 Assignment for breaking into main to make a class to make a pop up text before the application runs.

Files: No special files nor libraries besides what is being used.

How to run Program: It does a pop up you need to click ok for. Afteward, you start out with a pen that colors with a width and height of 1 in a black color.

If you click the red, green, or blue buttons, it changes the colors into those by half if it was not clicked already, if it is clicked twice then it becomes the pure color. If it is clicked again, the value is reset to 0. (It goes from 0, to 127, and then 255. After that it becomes zero again.) If you want colors besides those three, you can click for example red and green to make yellow, or other colors blend their RGB values together to get black, white, and more. There is a button near the colors at the bottom that resets it back to black.
There is a button on the top right that clears the board of any current drawing.
You can change the pen thickness by clicking the button on the top left. It changes them by 0.5 until it reaches 5, after that it resets to 0.5. A button nearby it resets the pen size back to 1.
Assumptions: That the user should be able to read the buttons and know what they might do. New is that the user knows to click ok to continue.

Challenges: Trying to figure out why it was not wanting to run the program at all.... Startup Object was being a pain for EntryPoint

Design decisions: I made the main a new file as I had errors for using MainWindows as the startup object. 

Bugs: Besides what was menthod at challenges, no bugs.

Results - The project was more of a pain than I thought it would be.

If you had more time: Figure out how the new main works
