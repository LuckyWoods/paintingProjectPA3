Info: Working on making a painting program with a few bare bone features such as clear, color changing, or changing pen size for a class assignment.

Files: No special files nor libraries besides what is being used.

How to run Program: You start out with a pen that colors with a width and height of 1 in a black color. 
1. If you click the red, green, or blue buttons, it changes the colors into those by half if it was not clicked already, 
   if it is clicked twice then it becomes the pure color. If it is clicked again, the value is reset to 0. (It goes from 0, to 127, and then 255. After that it becomes zero again.)
   If you want colors besides those three, you can click for example red and green to make yellow, 
   or other colors blend their RGB values together to get black, white, and more. There is a button near the colors at the bottom that resets it back to black. 
2. There is a button on the top right that clears the board of any current drawing.
3. You can change the pen thickness by clicking the button on the top left. It changes them by 0.5 until it reaches 5, after that it resets to 0.5. 
   A button nearby it resets the pen size back to 1.

Assumptions: That the user should be able to read the buttons and know what they might do.

Challenges: Trying to figure out how to do the colors and the thickness. I was going to try a slider, but was not sure how to work it.

Design decisions: I made the thickness button a rotation feature along with the colors as most people working with those basic colors. 
                  RGB values are the values are the easiest to work with for choosing color combinations. 
                  Buttons were placed away from eachother on different parts of the canvas as a way for the buttons not to be clustered together at the top.

Bugs: Besides what was menthod at challenges, no bugs.

Results - The project went well for what I was originally planning besides not being able to do sliders for thickness and color.

If you had more time: Figure out how to do the sliders and make them dissappear or appear when certain buttons are clicked.
